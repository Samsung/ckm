 * @brief    The key manager provides a secure repository protected by Tizen platform for keys, certificates, and sensitive data of users and/or their APPs. 
 *           Additionally, the key manager provides secure cryptographic operations for non-exportable keys without revealing key values to clients.

 * Additionally, it provides secure cryptographic operations for non-exportable keys without revealing key values to clients.

 *
 * The key manager provides 2 types of API.
 * - secure repository APIs : These APIs provides storing, retrieving, and removing functions for keys, certificates, and data.
 * - secure crypto APIs : These APIs provides additional cryptographic operations (create asymmetric key pair, sign/verify signature, verify certificate).
 *
 * Data Store Policy:
 *   A client can specify simple access rules when storing a data in Key Manager.
 *   - Exportable/Non-Exportable:
 *     Only for data tagged as exportable, Key Manager returns the raw value of the data.
 *     If data is tagged as non-exportable, Key Manager does not return its raw value.
 *     In that case, Key Manager provides secure cryptographic operations for non-exportable keys without revealing key values to clients.
 *   - Per Key Password:
 *     All data in Key Manager is protected by Tizen platform.
 *     Besides, a client can encrypt its data using its own password additionally.
 *     If a client provides a password when storing a data, the data will be encrypted with the password.
 *     This password should be provided when get the data from Key Manager.
 *
 * Data Access Control
 *   - By default, only the owner of a data can access to the data.
 *   - If the owner grants the access to other applications, those applications can read or delete the data from key-manager DB.
 *   - When an application is deleted, the data and access control information granted by the application are also removed.
 *
 * Alias Format
 *   - The format of alias is "package_id name".
 *   - If package_id is not provided by a client, the key-manager will add the package_id of the client to the name internally.
 *   - The client can specify only its own package id in the alias when storing a key, certificate, or data.
 *   - A client should specify the package id of the owner in the alias to retrieve a a key, certificate, or data shared by other applications.
 *   - Aliases are returned as the format of "package_id name" from the key-manager.
